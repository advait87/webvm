# Rick and Morty stuck in a terminal


This is a game to teach Linux newbies about Linux commands in a time bound game. To play this game, just do `sh start_game.sh` from the terminal.

This game was made in a time crunch and is to be played in a time crunch. It teaches newbies about Linux like no other. From basic commands like cd, touch, ls to how to use flags, and how to use grep, it's all here.

Thanks to WebVM for this amazing Hackathon.
